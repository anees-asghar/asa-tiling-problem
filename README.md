# ASA Project I: Tiling Problem

### Problem Description
We want to tile the area defined inside a rectangle bounded by the staircase path. 
The area to be tiled is defined over a unit grid, with n rows and m columns. 
The tiles to be used are squares with dimensions 1x1, 2x2, and so on. Since 
you can use an arbitrary number of square tile of various sizes, there are 
several possible configurations of the tiles that allow you to fully cover 
the area in question.

In the example below, there are four possible configurations to tile the area in 
question.

### Objective
The objective is to find the total number of distinct configurations of tiles 
that allow us to tile the given area.

### Solution Setup & Usage
- Compile the 'solution.cpp' file using the command `g++ solution.cpp -o solution.out`
- Run the executable on any test input file, e.g., `./solution.out < example_test.txt`  
Note that the input file should adhere to the input structure laid out by the project statement
